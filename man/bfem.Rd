\arguments{
\item{Y}{The data matrix. 
Categorical variables and missing values are not
  allowed.}

\item{K}{An integer vector specifying the numbers of mixture components
(clusters) among which the model selection criterion will choose the most
appropriate number of groups. Default is 2:6.}

\item{d}{An integer specifyin the dimension of the discriminative subspace. 
Default to K - 1.}

\item{model}{A vector of Bayesian discriminative latent mixture (BDLM) models
to fit. There are 12 different models: "DkBk", "DkB", "DBk", "DB", "AkjBk",
"AkjB", "AkBk", "AkBk", "AjBk", "AjB", "ABk", "AB".  The option "all"
executes the Fisher-EM algorithm on the 12 DLM models and select the best
model according to the maximum value obtained by model selection criterion.
Similar to \code{\link{fem}}}

\item{method}{The method used for the fitting of the projection matrix
associated to the discriminative subspace. Three methods are available:
'gs' (Gram-Schmidt, the original proposition), 'svd' (based on SVD, faster)
and 'reg' (the Fisher criterion is rewritten as a regression problem). The
'gs' method is the default method.}

\item{crit}{The model selection criterion to use for selecting the most
appropriate model for the data. There are 3 possibilities: "bic", "aic" or
"icl". Default is "icl".}

\item{maxit.em}{The maximum number of iterations before the stop of the main
EM loop in the BFEM algorithm.}

\item{eps.em}{The threshold value for the likelihood differences (Aitken's
criterion) to stop the BFEM algorithm.}

\item{maxit.ve}{The maximum number of iterations before the stop of the
VE-step loop (fixed point algorithm)}

\item{eps.ve}{The threshold value for the likelihood differences (Aitken's
criterion) to stop the BFEM algorithm.}

\item{lambda}{The initial value for the variance of the Gaussian prior on the
means in the latent space.}

\item{emp.bayes}{Should the hyper-parameters (mean and variance) of the prior be updated ? Default to TRUE.}

\item{init}{The initialization method for the Fisher-EM algorithm. There are
4 options: "random" for a randomized initialization, "kmeans" for an
initialization by the kmeans algorithm, "hclust" for hierarchical
clustering initialization or "user" for a specific initialization through
the parameter "Tinit". Default is "kmeans". Notice that for "kmeans" and
"random", several initializations are asked and the initialization
associated with the highest likelihood is kept (see "nstart").}

\item{nstart}{The number of restart if the initialization is "kmeans" or
"random". In such a case, the initialization associated with the highest
likelihood is kept.}

\item{Tinit}{A n x K matrix which contains posterior probabilities for
initializing the algorithm (each line corresponds to an individual).}

\item{kernel}{It enables to deal with the n < p problem. By default, no
kernel (" ") is used. But the user has the choice between 3 options for the
kernel: "linear", "sigmoid" or "rbf".}

\item{disp}{If true, some messages are printed during the clustering. Default
is false.}

\item{mc.cores}{The number of CPUs to use to fit in parallel the different
models (only for non-Windows platforms). Default is the number of available
cores minus 1.}

\item{subset}{A positive integer defining the size of the subsample, default
is NULL. In case of large data sets, it might be useful to fit a FisherEM
model on a subsample of the data, and then use this model to predict
cluster assignments for the whole data set. Notice that in, such a case,
likelihood values and model selection criteria are computed for the
subsample and not the whole data set.}

\description{
The Bayesian Fisher-EM algorithm is built on a Bayesian formulation of the
model used in the \code{\link{fem}}. It is a subspace clustering method for
high-dimensional data. It is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model and on the
idea that the data lives in a common and low dimensional subspace. A VEM-like
algorithm estimates both the discriminative subspace and the parameters of
the mixture model.
